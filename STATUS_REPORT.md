## Executive Summary

The Smart Document Management System (SmartDocs) is an AI-powered document management platform that automatically classifies, extracts, and searches personal and business documents. The system has completed its security hardening, full document processing pipeline, and ML classification upgrade — achieving 85.06% classification accuracy on real-world Indian financial documents, exceeding the >85% project target.

## Completed Phases — Detail

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security Hardening ✅
**Goal:** Eliminate critical vulnerabilities and establish migration framework.

**What was built:**
- Environment-based config — app refuses to start without `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`
- JWT access tokens (30 min) + opaque refresh tokens with rotation and reuse detection
- Rate limiting (slowapi) on auth + upload endpoints → 429 responses on abuse
- Security headers middleware: HSTS (2yr + preload), CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type
- Swagger/ReDoc disabled in production (`DEBUG=False`)
- Structured JSON logging (structlog) with correlation IDs on all requests
- Alembic migration framework with initial migration from existing schema

**Requirements completed:** SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04, SEC-05, INFR-01

### Phase 2: Document Processing Pipeline ✅
**Goal:** Async document processing with full format support and metadata extraction.

**What was built:**
- DOCX text extraction via python-docx (paragraphs + tables)
- OCR preprocessing pipeline: grayscale → Gaussian blur → adaptive threshold → deskew → morphological ops → multi-PSM retry (PSM 6 → PSM 3 fallback)
- Celery async processing wired to Redis — upload returns HTTP 202 immediately
- Celery task stages: reading (10%) → extracting (30%) → metadata (60%) → saving (80%)
- Exponential backoff retry on task failure (60s × 2^retries)
- Frontend bulk upload with per-file progress indicators + real-time status polling (every 2.5s)
- Automatic metadata extraction: dates (dateutil fuzzy, Indian formats), amounts (0.01–10M range validation), vendor names

**Requirements completed:** PROC-01 through PROC-07, INFR-05

---

### Phase 3: ML Classification Upgrade ✅
**Goal:** Document classification >85% accuracy on real-world documents with transparent metrics.

**What was built:**

**Plan 03-01 — Model Upgrade:**
- Added LinearSVC (with CalibratedClassifierCV for probability output) as third model candidate
- 3-model comparison: Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes vs Linear SVC
- TF-IDF vocabulary: 5K → 15K features, unigrams → trigrams (1,3) ngrams
- Synthetic augmentation factor raised to 10 for underrepresented categories
- **Result: 85.06% test accuracy** (up from 76.4% baseline), Linear SVC selected as best

**Plan 03-02 — Evaluation Dashboard:**
- ML evaluation API endpoint: `GET /api/ml/evaluation` — serves accuracy, per-category P/R/F1, confusion matrix
- Color-coded confidence badges on all document views (green ≥80%, yellow 50–79%, red <50%)
- Model evaluation dashboard page with confusion matrix (intensity-based red shading for misclassifications)

**Docker & Dataset Access:**
- Trained model `.pkl` files (3.6 MB total) committed to git — team gets them on `git pull`
- `docker-compose.yml` updated: bind mounts for `./backend/models` and `./backend/datasets`
- 28 GB Kaggle datasets accessible to team via `python -m app.ml.datasets.download`

**Requirements completed:** AIML-01, AIML-02, AIML-03, AIML-04

#### Per-Category Accuracy (Test Set, 308 samples)

| Category | Precision | Recall | F1 | Samples |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|---------|
| UPI | 100% | 100% | 100% | 48 |
| Tickets | 100% | 100% | 100% | 33 |
| Tax | 97% | 95% | 96% | 38 |
| Bank | 71% | 89% | 79% | 82 |
| Bills | 97% | 64% | 77% | 45 |
| Invoices | 75% | 69% | 72% | 62 |
| **Overall** | **86%** | **85%** | **85%** | **308** |

## Next: Phase 4 — Search & Retrieval

**Goal:** Replace ILIKE with PostgreSQL full-text search, add filters, fuzzy matching.

**Planned deliverables:**
- PostgreSQL FTS with `tsvector`/`tsquery` on document text + metadata
- Filter by category, date range, amount range
- Fuzzy search for partial/misspelled queries
- Paginated search results with relevance ranking

## Repository & Docker

**GitHub:** https://github.com/IIIT-HYD-PROD-LABS/Smart-Document-Management-System

**Docker Setup:**
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd "SMART DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- IIITHYD PROD LABS"
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Set SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, KAGGLE credentials in .env
docker compose up --build
```

**Services after `docker compose up`:**

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000 |
| API Docs | http://localhost:8000/docs (debug only) |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432 |
| Redis | localhost:6379 |

**Trained model** is included in git — no retraining needed on first run.

**To get datasets** (optional, for retraining only):
```bash
# Add KAGGLE_USERNAME + KAGGLE_KEY to .env first
docker compose run backend python -m app.ml.datasets.download
```
